        <h1>Rise Vision</h1>
        <p>Role: Digital Intern<br>
          Duration: October 2014 - Present<br>
          Reference: Ryan Cahoy, rjc@risevision.com<br>
          Website: <a href="http://www.risevision.com/" target="_blank">www.risevison.com</a><br>
        </p>
        <p>I work for Rise Vision as a Digitla Intern. I do a lot of different things in my average day at Rise. I will typically start my day by creating, finding, and scheduling all the content for their social channels. 
        <br><br>
        Then throughout my day I will check email and help customers with a variety of their needs. These range from small tech support problems, to selling 50 media players to a large digital signage distributor. It really depends on the day. 
        <br><br>
        Another part of my co-op* has been helping to design the user flow of our online store, re-design large portions of the website, and create effective landing pages.
        <br><br>
        I also help run the company blog, this is probably one of the more difficult parts of my job. B2B content marketing and writing about digital signage can sometimes be dry and boring. However it is a fun and unique challenge every day to create small "campaigns" and stories about new releases that interest people.  
        <br><br>
        Managing the monthly newsletter is also one of my responsibilities. I segment and create lists in mailchimp, Design, write, and code the newsletter. Then test across multiple browsers and mobile before blasting.
        <br><br>
        This co-op is ongoing and as I continue to do new things I will update this site.
        <p>
        <p style="font-size:14pt; !important">*I am in a commerce co-op program. To learn more about it drop down to the <a href="#dal"><span style="color:#F2AA20;">Dalhousie</span></a> section of my website.</p>

      <p>Role: Digital Intern<br>

      <p>
        The summer after my first year of university I decided I wanted some office/ real life experience before I started my first co-op. I had an interest in digital marketing and decided to apply to agencies in Toronto and see what I heard back.
        <br><br>
        I ended up applying to 30 someodd agencies, sending complete cold call emails to whatever email adress they had on their website. I heard back from one. I ended up getting the job and spent my summer at Community Agency as part of their digital team.
        <br><br>
        I helped the project manager with a wide range of tasks. I created proposals and quotes, determining the costs of websites through meeting with developers and designers. I developed responsive landing pages and splash pages used by major brands. 
        <br><br>
        Managed and updated multiple Squarespace and Wordpress sites. Also created training manuals for multiple sites built in Wordpress and Squarespace. I created email campaigns for major projects. I was involved in every step, from briefing the design team on the project to developing the email myself. Then testing using Litmus, blasting, and then reporting. 
        <br><br>
        I was also involved in content calendar creation for a number of brands social media channels. This involved ideation, creation, revision, and then scheduling. 
        <br><br>
        Another part of the job was updating the agency blog once a week with relevant and interesting content. I wrote pieces on wearable technology, social media war rooms, and marketing to generation Z. 
        <br><br>
        Lastly, I occasionaly helped the experimental marketing team set up and organize events. Some events I helped organize were Festival Libre for Bacardi, Pop Up Perrier,   and a bar event for Bombay Sapphire. 
        <br><br>
        This was an extremely valuable internship that taught me tremendous amounts about digital and experiential marketing as well as the way modern agencies funciton.

      <h1>Wilder Clothing</h1>
      <p>Role: Founder, Head of marketing and product development<br> 
         Duration: November 2012 - Present<br>
         Website: <a href="http://www.wilderclothing.com/" target="_blank">www.wilderclothing.com</a><br>
      </p>
      <p>
        A few years ago I went from wearing my New Balance running shoes and sweatpants to school every day to having an obsession (most likely un-healthy) with clothing, style, fashion, and the world that surrounded it. I  read every blog, magazine, and tweet I could about it. This persisted for sometime, then after browsing some online store a particular pocket-t struck me. It's price was a little to steep for my highschool student budget. That night I got my Mom (shout out to Daina) to sew a pocket on a black costco t-shirt. That night I wore the shirt out to a party and got some compliments. After the party (and a couple sodas) I was walking home with my friend Scott and we decided let's start a clothing brand. 
        <br><br>
        To start we made a Facebook page to market our shirts. Our merchandise was costco t-shirts that had pockets sewn onto them, they were pretty cool if I do say so my self. We realized that this is not the most efficient way to make money in fashion and so embarked on a mission to create our own cut and sew shirt. I have a family friend that works in fashion for Northern Reflections (to those that don't know this brand it is an old womens brand). 
        <br><br>
        She was able to help us find a factory and pattern maker. Now me and my friend Scott (we were both 16 at this time) organized getting the pattern made, and 100 shirts made. All the material and manufacturing was from and done in Canada. Those 100 shirts were the number one selling item at one of Toronto's "coolest" shops. 
        <br><br>
        Moving on to now, we have made a number of different pieces and it is something that to this day we continue to work on in our spare time.  We have sold in shops across Canada and our clothing has been sported by a number of notable figures. 
        <br><br>
        This endeavour has taught me a number of things. I've learned to hustle, as a 16 year old kid it's not easy to convince a shop owner to sell your clothing. I've learned time management and organization. How to sell a product, and create a brand that poeple connect with and enjoy. And lastly i've learned team work, shouts to Scott.

      <h1>Comeback Season / BDHD1837</h1>
      <p>Role: Digital marketer, event planner<br>
         Duration: July 2014 - Present<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        Comeback Season Kids is an event company and creative group. I started working with them towards the end of July 2014, I helped plan, set up and market events at a club in downtown Toronto called Tattoo. 
        <br><br>
        I also built three now defunct websites, one was for Ink Entertainment the entertainment company we worked under for the party. The other was a music site of all the artists affiliated with us and our own site. 
        <br><br>
        In December Comeback Season split up. Comeback Season still exists and continues throwing great parties in downtown Toronto. The other half that I work for has changed it's name to Buddhahood1837 (BDHD1837) and focuses more on branded events, and experiential marketing, as well as concerts and art shows. 
        <br><br>
        Comeback Season taught me a lot about the entertainment industry in Toronto. It also allowed me to continue practicing my digital marketing abilites and become a better team member.

    <h1>Craigleith Ski Club</h1>
    <p>Role: Ski Coach<br>
       Duration: Decmber 2011 - Present<br>

    </p> 
    <p>
      Craigleith Ski Club is a private ski club situated near Collingwood, Ontario. I was part of a team of 50+ coaches who all played a part in delivering one of North America's largest alpine ski racing programs. I helped develop atheletes in the under 10 age category. 
      <br><br>
      I've worked at Craigleith for 4 years now and love it. I think the ability to teach is a very important skill, and by coaching 7,8,9 year olds it's one I've been able to develop over time (I'm still working on it). 
      <br><br>
      On top of teaching, this job has taught me strong verbal and written communication skills. I have to coordinate and liase with parents regarding races, upcomming events, their childs athletic development, and adress any questions and concerns they have. The ability to diplomatically and professionally communicate in this way has been a valuable skill I have carried with me these past 4 years. 
      <br><br>
      Through this job I have discovered that there is a lot more to coaching any sport than what is seen at a casual glance.

    <h1>Dalhousie University</h1>
    <p>Role: Student<br>
       Duration: I am a second year student<br>
       Website: <a href="http://www.dal.ca/" target="_blank">www.dal.ca</a><br>
    </p>
    <p>I am currently in my second year of Dalhousie's Commerce Co-op program. This program in my opinion is rather genius. For a students first year they attend school for the typical 2 semesters then go on summer break. When they come back for second year the program changes so that you are in school for 4 months than on co-op for 4 months and do not get a summer. It continues like this untill 4th year when you go back to the standard set up. 
    <br><br>
    This program allows me to learn in a class room for 4 months and then go apply it (and make some money). I take courses like Marketing, Accounting, Finance, Math,  and then some electives. School has never been my strength which is one of the reasons I chose the co-op program. 
    <br><br>
    Outside of school I don't do many school sanctioned extracuriculars as I am more interested in charting my own path and doing specific things how and when they interest me. However I have become Bloomberg Terminal certified through the school, taken part in numerous school events, and I am part of the outdoors society.
